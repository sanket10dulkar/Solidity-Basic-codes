we need to define it as `external` and `payable`. 
It prevents transactions from failing and ensures a graceful recovery when undefined functions are invoked.

Take care to handle unexpected situations gracefully and ensure proper error handling to maintain the security and integrity of your contracts.

contract Fallback {
 event Log(string func, uint gas);
fallback() external payable {
 emit Log("fallback", gasleft());
 }
receive() external payable {
 emit Log("receive", gasleft());
 }
function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
 return address(this).balance;
 }
}
